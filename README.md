# üì± MalDroidAnalyzer

## üìù Overview
MalDroidAnalyzer is a tool designed to analyze Android malware datasets. It provides insights into the complexity and behavior of malware samples.

## üìã Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fato07/MalDroidAnalyzer.git
   cd MalDroidAnalyzer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Malware Dataset:**
   - Download the malware folder from the provided source.

4. **Configure the Path:**
   - Replace the path in `complexity.py` with the path to your downloaded malware folder.

## üöÄ Running the Project
1. **Run the Analyzer:**
   ```bash
   python complexity.py
   ```

2. **Resume Analysis:**
   - If the analysis was interrupted and you want to resume from the last processed APK, use the `--resume` flag:
   ```bash
   python complexity.py --resume
   ```

3. **Modify APK Samples Path:**
   - If you want to scan a different set of APK samples, update the `base_path` variable in the `main` function of `complexity.py`:
   ```python
   base_path = "./path_to_your_apk_samples"  # Update this path as needed
   ```

4. **View Results:**
   - The results will be output to the console or saved to a specified file, depending on the configuration in `complexity.py`.

## üìä Analyzing Results

The `analysis_results_master.csv` file generated by MalDroidAnalyzer contains detailed information about each APK's complexity score and various features. This data can be used for further analysis to gain insights into the behavior and complexity of Android malware over time.

### Using the Data Output

1. **Complexity Score Analysis:**
   - Track the complexity score of APKs over time to identify trends or patterns in malware sophistication.
   - Compare complexity scores across different APKs to determine which samples exhibit more complex behaviors.

2. **Feature Correlation:**
   - Analyze the correlation between different features (e.g., permissions count, obfuscated strings) and the complexity score to understand which features contribute most to complexity.

3. **Time Series Analysis:**
   - If the dataset includes timestamps, perform time series analysis to observe how malware complexity evolves over time.

4. **Clustering and Classification:**
   - Use machine learning techniques to cluster APKs based on their features or classify them into different categories of malware.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, or heatmaps to better understand the distribution and relationships of features within the dataset.

### Tools for Data Analysis

- **Python Libraries:**
  - Use libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` for data manipulation and visualization.
  - Employ `scikit-learn` for machine learning tasks such as clustering and classification.

- **Jupyter Notebooks:**
  - Utilize Jupyter Notebooks for interactive data analysis and visualization.

By leveraging the data output from MalDroidAnalyzer, you can gain valuable insights into the complexity and behavior of Android malware, aiding in the development of more effective detection and mitigation strategies.
